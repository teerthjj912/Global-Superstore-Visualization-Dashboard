# Global-Superstore-Visualization-Dashboard
PowerBI has been a great tool for visualizing huge amounts of data into an impressive and eye-catching dashboard. And I have used it to make this Global Superstore Visualization Dashboard, which takes about 51000 records as test input and helps in making this much more interesting and easy-to-understand. I have used many tools to display Profit, Sales, Different Counts, Targets, Segments and their differentiated Results/Applications in another dimensions, a Map to show the volume and intensity of sales visually over the whole world, etc.
