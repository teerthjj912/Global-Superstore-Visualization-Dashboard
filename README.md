# Global-Superstore-Visualization-Dashboard
PowerBI has been a great tool for visualizing huge amounts of data into an impressive and eye-catching dashboard. And I have used it to make this Global Superstore Visualization Dashboard, which takes about 51000 records as test input and helps in making this much more interesting and easy-to-understand. I have used many tools to display Profit, Sales, Different Counts, Targets, Segments and their differentiated Results/Applications in another dimensions, a Map to show the volume and intensity of sales visually over the whole world, etc. You can see the .pbix file (PowerBI file) in the repository as well as all the raw Excel data (about 51000 records; Excel file (.xlsx)) that I used to make it.
